## Introduction 📜

Greetings! In this frontend project, I will be combining my acquired knowledge in the technologies 🛠️ React.js + Vite, to create a fabulous Forntend  for an Ecommerce.


## Description 📝

After carefully analyzing the project requirements, We will develop an Ecommerce capable of the following features:

- User registration using Bcrypt for secure  passwords 🔒.
- User login with token  authentication 🎫.
- A cart where you can add products 📝.
- A profile view where you have your orders.
- A logout where the token is destroyed.
- Diferent views in the page, showing diferent icons depending if your logged or not.


## Essential Project Requirements

To ensure a smooth workflow and deliver an outstanding project,We will adhere to the following indispensable requirements:

- Version control using Git with two main branches: master (or main) and develop.
- An exceptional README presentation, covering all necessary information.

## Technologies Used 💻

For building this marvelous API,We will rely on the following technologies:

- React.js: A powerful JavaScript library to make very usefull and component based webpages 🟩.
- Vite: A fantastic framework from react, making more simple and less heavy components🚀.




### Components

- Register.
- Login.
- Home.
- Products.
- Cart.
- Profile.
- Header.
- Footer.

### React Router

- /Home.
- /Login.
- /Register.
- /Profile.

### Use Of SASS

 The use of Sass is implemented in the page, having a Colors.scss to have colors to use all over the page.
So if you need to change them, you dont have to change all the CSS of colors

### Design

Tryied to implement a nice dessign to the page, that has a nice mixure of colors.

## Extras ✨

I´ve implemented a responsive dessign so it is usable in all devices.

## To Improve

I´ll try to make all the extras, when i have some to to it, especially the search bar and the admin view.


## Deliverables 📦

I will upload the project to a public repository on GitHub and leave the link to the repository attached in Classroom. I ensure a comprehensive README with all necessary information.

Thank you for taking the time to review my README! 😄 If you have any other requests or changes, please let me know. Good luck with your task! 🚀
